We hope that you find it pretty straightforward to navigate the site. 

Here are some general guidelines: 

## Buttons

* All the navigation buttons are at the bottom of the page. From left to right:
  * Home - takes you back to the homepage
  * Edit - takes you to the Github source page where you can edit the note you're on
  * Search - takes you to the search page
  * Z-Index - displays all the notes in clusters

## Navigation Pane

* This pane displays all the links connected to the note:
  * Down - all the notes branching from the note
  * Automatic backlinking:
    * Up - all the notes which branch to the note
    * Other backlinks - relevant notes that are not related through branching
