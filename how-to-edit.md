To create a new page,

1. Go to the repository: <https://github.com/srid/reddit.zettel.page>

## How to Link to Other Zettel

Linking to a file within a Zettel indicates that it is branching off from it. Backlinks are automatically shown on the web browser. 

```markdown
* <file-name.md> --> this will show the link in the Zettel
<file-name.md>  --> this will not be shown in the Zettel but will be shown as linked (EDIT: Hmm, it worked last time but I guess not)

```
