## There are 4 types of notes

### 1. Fleeting notes
- these are temporary notes made throughout the day, while thinking or reading
- ideally, collect these notes into one or two main 'inboxes' so they're easier to process later
  - ex. digital and/or analog notebooks or folders
- when it's time to process them, you will sort through these notes, pick out useful, interesting, or relevant ideas, and either transform them into permanent notes, or discard/archive them.

### 2. Literature notes
- these are created for a specific resource, such as a book, article, web page, etc.
- notes are taken specifically on the content
- these notes are typically filed separately from your [permanent notes](#3-permanent-notes), such as with your <referencing> system. 

#### Guidelines
- be selective, rewrite it in your own words and make sure you understand the concept (or follow up on it if you don't at first)
- as when writing academic papers, use direct quotes sparingly
- is the content useful/interesting/relevant to you and/or your research?


### 3. Permanent notes
### 4. Index notes
