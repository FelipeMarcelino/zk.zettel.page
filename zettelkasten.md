## Welcome to the Public Zettelkasten for r/Zettelkasten!

What is it? ðŸ¤”

**Zettelkasten** is German for 'slip box' or 'card index'.

The Zettelkasten method enables users to store and organize knowledge, extend their memory, and generate new connections and ideas. 

Although it can have many applications, the version that is mainly discussed in this subreddit is the one developed by the prolific German social theorist, Niklas Luhmann, who viewed it as a "partner" in his writing process.[^1]

Luhmann's Zettelkasten consisted of wooden boxes containing over 60,000 notes written on small slips of paper.
